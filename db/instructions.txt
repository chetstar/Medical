Files:
db_aidcodes.py - csv formatted for copying into medical db.
schema.sql - schema file for medical db.

How to setup medical db.

In psql run:
CREATE DATABASE medical;

Run:
psql medical -f schema.sql (or psql medical < schema.sql)

Run:
psql medical -f copy.sql
That file needs to be modified with the absolute path of the .csv it is copying.
