This is a description of what uncut does that needs to be reimplemented in python.

1. Bring in data.  This is simple with the fixed width file and the info in column_names.

2. Sort CIN/eligibility data lowest to highest. Ignore empty data. Take the one that is highest.

3. Create Bday Column

4. Create and populate language column from codes in lang.

5. Fix City names inplace.

6. Replace codes with english in ethnicity.  The SPSS code groups a bunch of codes into asian/PI.
The data dictionary lists the actual ethnicity for each of these codes.  Is the way the spss does
it the way we need to do it?

7. Create Calendar column from eligMonth and EligYear

8. Save 'Meds%MonthUncut'
   Save 'MedsCurrentUncut'

   With the columns:

 [CaseName, respCounty, language, calendar, ssn, sex, ethnicity, street, state, zip, CIN, bday, 
 fname, lname, suffix, middleInitial, city, AidCode, OHC, SOCamount,  EligibilityStatus, 
 HCplanText, ResCounty, Govt, CountyCaseCode, CountyAidCode, CountyCaseID, MedicareStatus,
 HIC, CarrierCode, FederalContractNumber, PlanID, TypeID, HCPstatus, HCPcode, region,
 AidCodeSP1, RespCountySP1, EligibilityStatusSP1, AidCodeSP2, RespCountySP2, EligibilityStatusSP2,
 AidCodeSP3, RespCountySP3, EligibilityStatusSP3]

That only saves the first month.

Optimizations: Only load the columns we need from the medi-cal file or at least get rid of the
the ones we don't need immediatly after bringing all of them in.

9. Other stuff.  Work till here and test savReaderWriter.
