^0. Run aidcodesshort.sps - This takes the aidcode.sav file and drop a bunch of rows and then saves
the result as aidcodesshort which is brought in at step 8.

*1. Load  medical data file.

*2. Create calendar column

*3. Wide to long by month

^4. Save 'I:\temp\MedsEligExplodeX.sav' with columns:

[CIN, Calendar, EligibilityStatus, AidCode, RespCounty, SOCamount, MedicareStatus, HCPStatus, 
HCPCode, OHC, AidCodeSP1, RespCountySP1, EligibilityStatusSP1,  aidCodeSP2,  RespCountySP2, 
EligibilityStatusSP2, AidCodeSP3, RespCountySP3, EligibilityStatusSP3]

This file is probably not needed. Also, is it actually saved once per loop?

*5. Set HCplanText.

*6. Create MCelig Column and if any of the EligibilityStatus columns for that row are good, set 
MCelig to 1.  'good' is defined as having a starting character less than 5.

*7.select one record per person per month. Everybody and the months they were eligible
(about line 1070).  This is the only section that MCelig is used in?

*8.Bring in aidcodes file. !!! This brings in FFP, Full, etc columns. Very important!!!!

?9.Drop MCelig column.

*10. Wide to long by aid code.

*11. If AidCode is 10,20 or 60 and the first character of EligibilityStatus < 5 SSI = 1.
That creates a new column SSI and populates it with 1 if those conditions are met and leaves it 
empty otherwise.

*12. (lines 1126-1130) If (basically MCelig but the code for that repeated instead) and fosterx
new column Foster = 1, else new column foster is left empty.

*13. (lines 1131-1134) Same as above but with disabledx instead of fosterx.  Also the digit here
only has to be less than 9 instead of less than 5.
Note, if we skip the X naming convention used to to do the wide to long by month we'll need to
do some renames.

14. Create three new columns:

primary_Aid_Code (width = 2)
ELIGIBILITY_COUNTY_code (width = 2)
EligStatusBogus (width = 3)

*15. Run insert file='I:\Janet\staging\MedsEligDoIfsFFPnewX.sps'.
This does all sorts of very specific business rule stuff. ^^^^Sets MCrank^^^^

16. RetroMC.  Set if a past month has a valid eligibilityStatus.  Need to talk to chet/Janet about
this.  RetroMC is not in chets work.

17. If eligibilityStatus ==5, SOCmc = 1

18. Create new columns:
CCSaidCode (width = 2 )
IHSSaidCode (width = 2 )

19. If aidcode in ("9K","9M","9N","9R","9U","9V","9W") the ccsaidcode = aidcode

20. if aidcode in ("2L","2M","2N") then ihssaidcode = aidcode

21. Format medsmonth as MOYR6.

22. save ExplodeCurrentNoDupeAidCode.sav
