1. Load data file.

2. Create calendar column

3. Wide to long by month

4. Save 'I:\temp\MedsEligExplodeX.sav' with columns:

[CIN, Calendar, EligibilityStatus, AidCode, RespCounty, SOCamount, MedicareStatus, HCPStatus, 
HCPCode, OHC, AidCodeSP1, RespCountySP1, EligibilityStatusSP1,  aidCodeSP2,  RespCountySP2, 
EligibilityStatusSP2, AidCodeSP3, RespCountySP3, EligibilityStatusSP3]

This file is probably not needed. Also, is it actually saved once per loop?

5. Set HCplanText.

6. Create MCelig Column and if any of the EligibilityStatus columns for that row are good, set 
MCelig to 1.  'good' is defined as having a starting character less than 5.

7.select one record per person per month. Everybody and the months they were eligible
(about line 1070).  This is the only section that MCelig is used in?

8.Bring in aidcodes file. 
9.Drop MCelig column.

10. Wide to long by month.

11. If AidCode is 10,20 or 60 and the first character of EligibilityStatus < 5 SSI = 1.
That creates a new column SSI and populates it with 1 if those conditions are met and leaves it 
empty otherwise.  We could use MCelig here and get better data?

12. (lines 1126-1130) If (basically MCelig but the code for that repeated instead) and fosterx
new column Foster = 1, else new column foster is left empty.

13. (lines 1131-1134) Same as above but with disabledx instead of fosterx.  
Note, if we skip the X naming convention used to to do the wide to long by month we'll need to
do some renames.

14. Create three new columns:
primary_Aid_Code (width = 2)
ELIGIBILITY_COUNTY_code (width = 2)

EligStatusBogus (width = 3)

15. Run insert file='I:\Janet\staging\MedsEligDoIfsFFPnewX.sps'.
This does all sorts of very specific business rule stuff.
